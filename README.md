# Time Predict - Proudest Achievement

My proudest achievement is a personal iOS app named Time Predict. This app is similar to the default clock app that allows to add cities/countries from the world that helps us know the time in that specific city/country.
Additionally, I have added a landscape image on each city that shows if it's day or night in that particular city. The image is drawn programmatically using ```CALayers``` and ```UIBezierPaths```.
The most interesting feature about this app is that it has a small control at the bottom that lets you manipulate your current time which helps you see the time in other cities/countries with respect to your manipulated time.

## Impact
When I was working with few clients based in London, Germany, and Portugal, this app helped me a lot to know the time differences to plan for meetings, demos, etc.
I have got a lot of positive feedback on this app from my colleagues and clients I have worked with.
This app is still under development and I will be adding support for iPad and MacOS and the app will be on App store soon.
