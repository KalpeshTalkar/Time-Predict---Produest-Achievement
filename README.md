# Time Predict - Produest Achievement

My proudest achievement is a personal iOS app named Time Predict. This app is similar to the default clock app that allows to add cities/countries from the world that helps us know the time in that specific city/country.
Additionally, I have added a landscape image on each city that shows if it's day or night in that particular city. The image is drawn programmatically using CALayers and UIBezierPaths.
The most interesting feature about this app is that it has a small control at the bottom that lets you manipulate your current time which helps you see the time in other cities/countries with respect to the your manipulated time.

When I was working with few clients based in London, Germany, and Portugal, this app helped me a lot to know the time differences to plan for meetings, demos, etc.
I have got a lot of positive feedback on this app from my colleagues and clients I have worked with.
This app is still under development and I am adding support for iPad and MacOS and will be on App store soon.
